Some Algorithms for Easy Reuse in Simulations

1) AStarAlgorithm.py - Barebones code for the algorithm; can be modified for use elsewhere
2) AStarSim_SingleRobot.py - Algorithm simulated for 1 robot using PyGame
3) AStarSim_MultiRobotWithClashes - Algorithm simulated for multiple robots using PyGame, clashes are allowed
4) AStarSim_MultiRobotWithClashPenalty - Algorithm simulated for multiple robots using PyGame, clashes are heavily penalized

These are stand-alone files; each individual python script suffices to run one program. I will progressively clean up the code as I add more features.

Required Libraries:
1) PyGame
2) NumPy

Tested for Python 2.7

The following shows AStarSim_MultiRobotWithClashPenalty.py in action:
